To refactor your chess app for OOP, SOLID, and best practices, the following steps are recommended:

Encapsulate Chess Logic in Classes:

Create classes for ChessBoard, Piece (with subclasses for each type), Move, and Game.
Move all chess logic (move generation, validation, check/checkmate, etc.) out of MainPage and into these classes.
Use Dependency Injection and Interfaces:

Define interfaces for services (e.g., IChessGameService) to allow for future microservice or AI integration.
Keep UI and Logic Separate:

MainPage should only handle UI and call methods on the ChessGame class.
Follow SOLID Principles:

Single Responsibility: Each class does one thing (e.g., ChessBoard manages state, Piece knows its moves).
Open/Closed: Add new piece types or rules without modifying existing code.
Liskov Substitution: All Piece subclasses can be used wherever a Piece is expected.
Interface Segregation: Use small, focused interfaces.
Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
Best Practices:

Use clear naming, comments, and XML documentation.
Make code testable (unit tests for chess logic).
Use immutability where possible for move history.
Next Step:
I'll create a new ChessGame class (with ChessBoard, Piece, and Move), refactor the logic out of MainPage, and update the UI to use this new structure. This will lay the foundation for microservice or AI integration later.

Letâ€™s start by scaffolding the core OOP structure in new files.

Created Piece.cs

Created ChessBoard.cs

Created Move.cs

Created ChessGame.cs

The chess app is now being refactored for OOP and SOLID principles:

Created Piece (abstract, with King as an example), ChessBoard, Move, and ChessGame classes in a new Models folder.
These classes will encapsulate all chess logic, making the code modular, testable, and ready for microservice or AI integration.
Next steps:

Add the rest of the piece classes (Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn).
Move all chess logic from MainPage to these classes.
Update the UI to use the new OOP structure.
